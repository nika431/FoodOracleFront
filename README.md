    #FoodOracle
FoodOracle is a web application that helps you track your food’s expiry dates. It can also save food by informing other users about your inventory, allowing them to take food you do not wish to use.

Example: A restaurant fails to use all its food, which would otherwise go to waste. Instead, they can post it on FoodOracle, so others can claim it, reducing food waste and positively impacting the environment.

Future plans: We can enhance the app by adding two inventories:

Shared inventory – exposes food to other users.

Private inventory – for users who want to track their food but not share it.

We can also add expiry warnings when a food item has less than 7 days left. This is partially implemented already: currently, it shows color-coded alerts, but no actual warning notification is given yet.
